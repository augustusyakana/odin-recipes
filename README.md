Project: Odin Recipes

This project will demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of HTML. 

Odin Recipes will be a recipe site consisting of multiple pages. We will have the home page obviously, then we are adding a page for every recipe on the menu. The recipe page will have specific ingredients for the recipe and cooking instructions as well.
