Project: Odin Recipes

This project will demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of HTML. 

Odin Recipes will be a recipe site consisting of multiple pages. We will have the home page obviously, then we are adding a page for every recipe on the menu. The recipe page will have specific ingredients for the recipe and cooking instructions as well. 

Planning and Execution: For every page I will be creating a wireframe to reference. I will then use HTML and CSS to execute the plan. The recipe pages will all have the same wireframe setup only different content.
